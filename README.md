the webpage for funeral services 
This page was made for friend which wanted to offer funeral services.
Its a simple page wihtout any JavaScript
BUilt it with Bootstrap4 framework because had used a tutorial about bootstrap so wanted to expierence and test it tout. Get to conclusion bootstrap is nice framework. Its way faster and also much simpler to build responsive webpages.
Imported php code for contact form and edited a little bit so its reloads instead of opens blank page.

Learned in this project:
  *about bootstrap
  *a little bit about installing nodes using npm from terminal
